Makefile:
    Edited form of a file provided by Wesley Mackey. 
    Based on the Makefile found in expr-smc

astree.cpp:
    Edited form of a file provided by Wesley Mackey. Added a 
    function to swap symbols and modified print function to 
    generate .tok file and .ast file.

astree.h:
    File Provided by Wesley Mackey.

auxlib.cpp:
    File provided by Wesley Mackey. 

auxlib.h:
    File provided by Wesley Mackey. 

lyutils.cpp:
    File provided by Wesley Mackey.

lyutils.h:
    File provided by Wesley Mackey.

string_set.cpp:
    File provided by Wesley Mackey.

string_set.h:
    File provided by Wesley Mackey.

scanner.l:
    Flex file that converts symbols into tokens recognized 
    by the provided parser.y file. Detects all symbols,
    keywords, and excape characters required by the 
    assignment odf.

parser.y:
    Handles all syntax accepted by the oc languange. Unfortunately, 
    I could not solve the shift/reduce conflicts that occur at the 
    variable nonterminal.

symbol_table.cpp:
    Generates the symbol table for the oc program. Currently causes
    one Seg Fault when run on the test code.

symbol_table.h:
    Standard header file for symbol_table.cpp.

emitter.cpp:
    Emits the an oil file created by parsing through the astree.
    The meets teh requirements for local and gloabl variable 
    declarations. A switch statement  handles the emission of 
    each kind of token and most function mangle strings to 
    assembly accepted format. A small set of token's were not 
    handled and emit string such as "ident a". While, if, and 
    else statements handled as well as arrays, allocs, and ptrs. 
    All tokens that produce headers at the front of the line do so. 
    Any other print statement occurs at exactly 10 spaces of indent.

emitter.h:
   Standard header file for emitter.cpp

main.cpp:
    Reads input .oc file using yylex(). Stores tokens
    using the astree data structure and prints them to the .tok file
    in the lexer::token() function of lyutils.cpp. Also stores tokens
    in a string_set data structure and prints to to the .str file.
    Generates the abstract syntax and stores it in the .ast file.
    Also generates the .sym file for the symbol table.
    Please read comments in main.cpp for more information about
    specific functions.
